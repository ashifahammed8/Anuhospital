As Andhra Pradesh’s Chief Minister ‘Nara Chandra Babu’ Naidu took an initiative in decimating the carriers of contagious diseases, we are doing our best to employ the initiative, our aim is to wipe out the diseases like Malaria, Dengue, Swine Flu, Typhoid etc from the state, and to do our part we are running campaigns and creating an awareness on the cause of the disease and precautions to avoid them. What we believe is ‘nothing in this world can compensate a perfect health’, we are trying our best in setting up a legitimate perception on the health. The Government of Andhra Pradesh oflately took an initiative on people’s health, which is a satisfactory phenomenon so far.   </p></div>
