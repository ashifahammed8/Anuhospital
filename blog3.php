                    <div class="text"><p style="text-align: justify;">What is a laparoscopic surgery? Well, these days Laparoscopic surgery is a widely acclaimed surgery technique in which surgeons use small incisions and long pencil-like instruments in order to perform operations using a camera, the camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to the monitor, which helps the surgeon to get a clearer view of the underlying problem. The reasons why laparoscopic is widely accepted are, as the incisions are much smaller than their open counterparts, and when compared to the regular operations recovery is very quick and post-operative pain is typically less. Laparoscopic surgeries are usually performed for hernia repairs, gastric bypass, bowel resection, and organ removal etc. </p></div>

                  <h4> Hernia Repair Through Laparoscopic </h4>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  Having already explained how a laparoscopic surgery performed, here is a detailed explanation on repairing hernia through laparoscopic. Laparoscopic has become the most used technique in the recent times and when a patient is about to go through the surgery, he is given a general anesthesia and the surgeon makes several small incisions in the lower abdomen and inserts a laparoscope-a thin tube with a tiny video camera attached to one end. The camera sends a magnified image from inside the body to a monitor, giving the surgeon a close-up view of the hernia and the surrounding tissue 

                  Having a clearer look at the hernia,  and while viewing the monitor, the surgeon uses instruments to carefully repair the hernia using synthetic mesh.However, the surgeons may determine that the laparoscopic is not the best option in case the hernia is very large, or the patient already has had a pelvic surgery. 

                  Post operation, the surgeon will discuss when a person may safely return back to work, also suggests refraining from heavyweight lifts and vigorous activities. Infants and children also experience some discomfort but usually resume normal activities after several days. </p></div>

                    <h4>Gastric Bypass Through Laparoscopic</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Gastric Bypass surgery helps in restricting food intake and the absorption of food which results in losing weight with no side effects. Food intake is limited by a small pouch that is similar in size to the adjustable gastric band. In addition, absorption of food in the digestive tract is reduced by excluding most of the stomach, duodenum, and upper intestine from contact with food by routing food directly from the pouch into the small intestine.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Usually, the operation is performed laparoscopically which involves making five to sin incisions in the abdomen, and through the incisions, a small tube connected to a video camera and surgical tools is being sent and the surgeon staples the top portion of the stomach with the help of the video on the monitor, the staple helps in creating a small stomach pouch which restricts food intake. Jejunum, a section of small intestine is then attached to the small stomach pouch which allows the food to bypass the lower stomach, the duodenum, this process helps reduce the number of calories and nutrients body absorb, called malabsorption.  </p>

                  <div class="text">
                     <h4> Bowel resection </h4>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Bowel Resection is a surgery to remove all or part of your large bowel, this surgery is also called colectomy. The colon is the large intestine, it is the lower part of your digestive tract.  After the food is swallowed, it begins to be digested in the stomach and then empties into the small intestine, the remaining waste moves through the colon to the rectum is expelled from the body.</p></div>

                  <div class="text"><p style="text-align: justify;"> Minimally Invasive laparoscopic colon surgery allows surgeons to perform many common colon procedures through small incisions. Each year more than 600,000 surgeries are performed in the United States to treat regular colon diseases, treating colon diseases through laparoscopy has become the easiest and the safest procedure, as depending on the type o procedure, patients may leave the hospital in a few days and get back to their normal activities more quickly than patients recovering from an open surgery. </p></div>

                 
                   <div class="text"><p style="text-align: justify;">In most of the cases, surgeons operate through 4 or 5 small openings while watching an enlarged image of the patient's internal organs on a monitor.
